In this lab, we will explore the concept of comments in Java, which are essential for code documentation and readability.

**Single-line Comment:**

In Java, you can create a single-line comment using two forward slashes `//`. Single-line comments are used for brief explanations or annotations within your code.

Example:

```
// This is a comment
System.out.println("Hello World");
```

**Multi-line Comment:**

Multi-line comments, also known as block comments, are used when you need to provide more detailed explanations or comments that span multiple lines. In Java, you create a multi-line comment by enclosing the text within `/*` and `*/`.

Example:

```
/* The code below will print the words Hello World
to the screen, and it is amazing */
System.out.println("Hello World");

```

Throughout this lab, you will practice using both single-line and multi-line comments to enhance your code's clarity and maintainability.
